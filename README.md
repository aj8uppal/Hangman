Hangman
=======

This version of Hangman has three levels: easy, medium, and hard.
Depending on the level, the program fills in some of the characters on a randomly picked **animal**.

We use a module, `termcolor`, to color the text. You can get `termcolor` by typing in

    pip install termcolor
    
Into your command line.

From there, we define several user-modules, `animals`, `typewrite`, `figures`, *for the graphics* and `colors`.

Enjoy!
